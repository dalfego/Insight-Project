# Insight-Project

#### As a consulting project for Insight Data Science, this repository contains notebooks outlining a short, 2-week long project that sought to create a run duration predictor for a user looking increase their activity levels and reach certain health goals in a day (i.e. sleep for a certain amount or reach a number of steps). The repository contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and regression model, plus a folder for a developed web app to present the model, hosted on Heroku.

##### Due to the nature of the consulting project, the company has asked for any data .csv to not be included in the repository. Notebooks are for seeing data analysis and process only (all identifying information has been removed).
